This is a very basic implementation of CNN using NumPy. It is not optimised and is missing a whole lot of features.
This is my first try of a CNN upon which I will build better, more modular, and more flexible CNN's. More updates 
will be incoming. 

The CNN here has only ReLu activation for convolutional layers and sigmoid activation for Fully Connected layers,
with padding = 0 and strides = 'Valid'. The size of Fully Connected Layers is also fixed with the number of nodes 
equal to the number of incoming inputs.
